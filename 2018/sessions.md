## 2. Algorithms and applications for curves and surfaces

### Organizers

*   [Jin-San Cheng](mailto:) ()
*   [Vikram Sharma](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope


Curves and Surfaces play a fundamental role in many fields, such as
Computational Geometry, Computer Aided Design, Computer Graphics,
Geometric Modeling to name a few. Consequently, softwares that provide
functionalities to handle them are very important. The aim of this
session is to facilitate communication between researchers who have
developed or plan to develop mathematical software related to implicit
or parametric curves and surfaces.  The softwares could be, for
instance, for handling arrangements of curves and surfaces, or
visualizing them, or computing their cell decomposition, or using them
as a tool in various applications. We welcome talks that highlight
some of the mathematical and algorithmic challenges that are faced in
designing softwares for curves and surfaces, and demonstrate some of
the recent advances made in this direction.

### Topics (including, but not limited to)

*   Algorithms for computing the topology of implicit curves and surfaces
*   Efficient algorithms for visualizing implicit curves and surfaces
*   Applications of curves and surfaces in scientific computing
*   Performing boolean operations (such as intersection, union, etc.) on curves and surfaces


## 3. Symbolic Summation and Integration

### Organizers

*   [Christoph Koutschan](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

The symbolic evaluation of (definite and indefinite) sums and integrals
is an important topic in symbolic computation, and it is widely
appreciated by users of computer algebra systems. From highschool
students, who solve their homework integrals with freely available and
easy-to-use tools such as WolframAlpha, to physicists, who employ highly
specialized algorithms and software packages for simplifying complicated
multi-sums, they all take advantage of the power of computer algebra
software. This session is dedicated to the presentation and discussion
of new trends in the areas of symbolic summation and symbolic
integration, with a special emphasis on newly developed software for
evaluating / simplifying sums and integrals, either in an explicit /
implicit form or numerically.


## 4. Polyhedral methods in geometry and optimization 

### Organizers

*   [Michael Joswig](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

Convex polyhedra occur in optimization as the feasible regions of linear programs.
Moreover, integer linear programming is the same as linear programming over the
convex hull of the lattice points in a polyhedron.
In algebraic geometry and its applications piecewise-linear shapes occur in the
guise of polyhedral fans.
Examples include secondary and Groebner fans, which play major roles, e.g., in
tropical geometry.
This session wants to bring together people working on algorithms and software
dealing with any of the above.


### Topics

Specific topics include, but are not restricted to, the following:
*    convex hull computations
*    mixed integer linear programming
*    explicit methods for triangulating point configurations
*    computations in toric or tropical geometry
*    parallelization of polyhedral computations
*    polyhedral methods in algebraic statistics
*    algorithms exploiting symmetry in any of the above 



## 5. The 29th OpenMath Workshop

### Organizers

*   [James Davenport](mailto:) ()
*   [Michael Kohlhase](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

[OpenMath](http://www.openmath.org) is a language for exchanging
mathematical formulae across applications (such as computer algebra
systems). From 2010 its importance has increased in that OpenMath
Content Dictionaries were adopted as a foundation of the
[MathML 3 W3C recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML), the standard for
mathematical formulae on the Web.

### Topics:

The OpenMath Workshop is the annual meeting of the OpenMath
Society. 

  * Feature Requests (Standard Enhancement Proposals) and Discussions
    for going beyond OpenMath 2;
  * Further convergence of OpenMath and MathML 3;
  * Reasoning with OpenMath;
  * OpenMath on the Semantic Web;
  * New OpenMath Content Dictionaries;
  * Software using or processing OpenMath;

though others related to OpenMath are certainly welcomed. For examples
of contributions see the previous OpenMath workshops at
https://openmath.github.io/meetings/



## 6. Post-Quantum Group-based Cryptography

### Organizers

*   [Delaram Kahrobaei](mailto:) ()
*   [Vladimir Shpilrain](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

The National Security Agency (NSA) in August 2015 announced plans for transition to post-quantum algorithms.  Currently, Suite B cryptographic algorithms are specified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and are used by NSA's Information Assurance Directorate in solutions approved for protecting classified and unclassified National Security Systems (NSS). Below, we announce preliminary plans for transitioning to [quantum resistant algorithms](https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/)
Shortly thereafter the National Institute of Standardization and Technology announced a call to select standards for post-quantum public-key cryptosystems.
The academic and industrial communities have suggested the following as potentially quantum-resistant primitives: lattice-based, multivariate, code-based, hash-based, isogeny-based, and group-based primitives.
Group-based primitives are the topic of our special session. We will invite researchers from computational group theory, cryptography, and quantum computation communities to discuss various problems in group-based cryptography, with an emphasis on problems such as the hidden subgroup problem that cut across all these areas.




## 7. Groebner Bases

### Organizers

*   [Bruno Buchberger](mailto:) ()
*   [Alexander Maletzky](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

 
 Groebner bases (and related bases like characteristic sets, Groebner bases in differential rings, etc.) have found numerous applications in all areas of science and technology. Since the computation of such bases is known to be intrinsically complex, the improvement of algorithms for their computation and software for the many applications of Groebner bases is of utmost importance. Considerable progress has been made over the past decades and years in this area. Note however that this session is not a forum for the theory of Groebner bases and complexity. We want to focus exclusively on the implementation, software, and application aspect. 

### Topics (including, but not limited to)
*    Practical improvements of the algorithms for computing Groebner bases and related bases
*    Generic implementation of Groebner bases
*    Particularly efficient implementation of Groebner bases in special domains
*    Numerical versions of Groebner bases computation
*    Implementation of Groebner bases on parallel machines, high-perfomance computers, special hardware
*    Special user interfaces for Groebner bases applications
*    Implementation of Groebner bases algorithms in general mathematical software systems
*    Special software systems that focus on the computation and applications of Groebner bases
*    Case studies for the use and computation of Groebner bases in particularly complex and / or practically important cases
*    Success stories and feasibility reports on the use of Groebner bases etc. in science, technology, engineering, economy, medicine etc.
*    Success stories and feasibility reports on the use of Groebner bases etc. inside mathematics (mathematical reasoning, geometric reasoning, experimental mathematics, cryptography etc.)
*    Comparison (of computing times and other efficiency criteria) of various implementations


## 8. Machine Learning for Mathematical Software

### Organizers

*   [Matthew England](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope


While there has been some discussion on how Computer Algebra Systems could be used for AI there is little literature on applications in the other direction.  However, recent results for quantifier elimination suggest that given enough example problems there is scope for tools like Support Vector Machines to improve the performance of Computer Algebra Systems.  It may seem that the inherently probabilistic nature of machine learning tools would invalidate the exact mathematical results prized by such software, however, algorithms and implementations often come with a range of choices which have no effect on the mathematical correctness of the end result but a great effect on the resources required to find it.  This sessions aims to promote thought on whether, where, and how best machine learning could be applied to mathematical software development.


## 9. Satisfiability Checking and Symbolic Computation

### Organizers

*   [Erika Abraham](mailto:) ()
*   [James Davenport](mailto:) ()
*   [Matthew England](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

Software tools for checking the satisfiability of real-algebraic formulas play an important role in a wide range of applications. Such tools are being developed in Mathematics in form of computer algebra systems as well as in Computer Science as SAT-modulo-theories (SMT) solvers. With this topical session we want to strengthen the exchange between these areas, with presentations about algorithms and software tools from both domains and success stories about how the two communities can profit from achievements of each other.

## 10. Mathematical Interfaces: Computing, Modeling, Web & Mobile

### Organizers

*   [Marco Pollanen](mailto:) ()
*   [Yasuyuki Nakamura](mailto:) ()
*   [Masataka Kaneko](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

The theme of this session is the user interfaces that mathematics researchers and learners 
use for reasoning, computing, and interacting with mathematical objects. Though recent 
developments in information technology have been improving the capability and efficiency of 
various interfaces for computation, visualization, and knowledge propagation, further 
refinement is needed for these interfaces to be fully utilized for mathematical activities. 
The exchange of knowledge and experience in the construction and practical use of mathematical 
interfaces would be helpful. Also, the unification of functionality throughout different 
interfaces may lead to deeper and wider applications. This session will bring together 
researchers, developers, and users of various mathematical web/mobile interfaces, computing 
environments, and scientific visualization tools to provide a forum for discussing common and 
distinct challenges and further developments. This session accepts papers that address related 
research and development and present new technologies. Papers exploring both research and 
educational experiences by using these technologies in an original way are also welcomed.


## 11. Backtrack search techniques in groups and combinatorics

### Organizers

*   [Markus Pfeiffer](mailto:) ()
*   [Christopher Jefferson](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

Backtrack search is a vital part of solving many problems in computational group
  theory, such as graph isomorphism, finding (non-point) stabilisers and
  normalisers in permutation groups, finding canonical images of objects under a
  group action, or short solutions to equations over a free group.

  Efficient backtrack search implementations require a symbiosis of efficient algorithms,
  high-performance code, and sophisticated mathematical methods to prune search
  space. Some of the most prominent backtrack methods in computational mathematics
  are McKay's graph isomorphism algorithm, Jeffrey Leon's partition backtrack
  method for permutation groups, and Bernd Schmalz' "snakes and ladders" algorithm.

  Many breakthroughs in AI-search, such as learning, heuristics and parallelism,
  can improve performance by multiple orders of magnitude, and are applicable in
  computational group theory.

### Topics

  We would like to invite experts from AI, combinatorics, computational group
  theory and related areas with the aim of sharing and exchanging ideas, problems,
  results and implementations.


## 12. Computational Algebraic Geometry

### Organizers

*   [Dan Bates](mailto:) ()
*   [Dani Brake](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

This session will bring together researchers and practitioners who solve polynomial systems using numerical and hybrid symbolic-numeric methods. This session will consider new algorithmic and computational approaches as well as applications.

### Topics

The topics include algebraic geometry, applications of algebraic geometry, computational algebra, computer algebra systems, hybrid symbolic-numeric methods, and numerical algebraic geometry. 

## 13. Symbolic Combinatorics 

### Organizers

*   [Stephen Melczer](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

Symbolic Combinatorics is roughly defined as the application of symbolic algorithms to problems in enumerative and algebraic combinatorics.  This session aims to publicize recent algorithms, software implementations, and various applications.

### Topics

Topics include the manipulation of generating functions, algorithms for asymptotics, and the study of multivariate integer sequences.


## 14. Towards Composable Mathematical Software

### Organizers

*   [Markus Pfeiffer](mailto:) ()
*   [Florian Rabe](mailto:) ()
*   [Nicolas Thiery](mailto:) ()

### Aim and Scope

There is a wealth of mathematical software available today, most of which are
  free and open-source, but very specialised: for example nauty for graph
  isomorphism, Singular for polynomials, Pari for number theory. Additionally
  there are databases of objects like the OEIS, or the Small Group Library.
  
  In contemporary mathematics research, we use and combine these specialised
  tools, which requires domain-specific knowledge, data access and conversion,
  and low-level programming for interfacing between them.

  This is tedious, error-prone, and does not scale: Addressing the demand for
  better composability there are huge software packages like SageMath, data
  description languages like OpenMath, and RPC mechanisms like SCSCP.

  The aim of this session is to provide a forum for developers and users of
  mathematical software with an interest in composablity and interoperability of,
  and knowledge and data exchange between systems, to share experiences, solutions,
  and a vision for the future.


## 15. Management of Mathematical Software, Mathematical Knowledge and Research Data

### Organizers

*   [Wolfram Sperber](mailto:wolfram@zbmath.org) (zbMATH)
*   [Patrick D. F. Ion](mailto:pion@umich.edu) (GDML WG & University of Michigan)

### Aim and Scope

The focus of the session will be on concepts, tools, and services
for handling, maintaining, and using mathematical software or
mathematical knowledge more generally. Mathematical software is
indispensible for scientific research but also plays a central role
mediating between mathematics and applications. It embodies a great
deal of mathematical knowledge, and sometimes directly requires
developing more. Key technologies use mathematical software for
computer simulations. But the development of an efficient
infrastructure for mathematical software is challenging: software
development is distributed, software has a life cycle, usage
conditions vary, and standards for handling of software information
are lacking. In addition, the incorporation of software into the
scientific record brings to the fore questions of replicability and
reproducibility that now extend to mathematical knowledge. With the
change in trust for science, and even within it, it is imperative
to have clear standards for truth and tools that support them.

### Topics

The session will cover different aspects and types of software
knowledge management, especially the development of standards,
tools, and services for software, concepts for content analysis,
and semantic interfaces.  These are requirements for both improved
facilities for search on mathematical software and automated,
semantically controlled, use of mathematics. The contexts for
mathematical software, especially models, algorithms, and data  
and its embedding into the existing information infrastructure of 
mathematics will be part of discussion. The aim to define the framework 
for best practices in mathematical software and knowledge management.



## 16. Software for exact and certified numeric computations

## 17. Math in 2050 - Creativity, Publication, and Application supported by Knowledge Bases and Software?

### Organizers

*   [Michael Kohlhase](mailto:michael.kohlhase@fau.de) (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg)
*   [Patrick D. F. Ion](mailto:pion@umich.edu) (GDML WG & University of Michigan)

### Aim and Scope

The Math2050 Session explores community perceptions of future
workflows in "doing mathematics" (the conception, publication,
dissemination, and application of mathematical knowledge). It follows
upon an ICMS event in Berlin organized by the International Mathematical
Knowledge Trust ([IMKT](http://imkt.org); chartered by the IMU and funded
by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to help bring about a global digital
mathematics library).  The question of how to encode mathematical
semantics that is at the heart of what future mathematics will be,
was considered at a Fields Institute workshop in February 2016
and is still an active one.

### Topics and Publications

The workshop seeks technical contributions and position papers on
novel/computer-supported workflows and information resources for
the practice of the mathematical sciences. The contributions will
be used as anchors to an open discussion on how "doing mathematics
could change in the next 30 years (one full generation of
mathematicians).  The contributors will be invited to submit
articles to a special issue of "Mathematics in Computer Science".


## 18. Quantifier Reasoning

### Organizers

*   [Mikolas Janota](mailto:mikolas.janota@gmail.com) (IST, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal)
*   [Andrew Reynolds](mailto:andrew.j.reynolds@gmail.com) (University of Iowa, USA)

### Aim and Scope

The session aims at promoting discussion between researchers working on
automated solving of problems involving quantifiers.  Reasoning with
quantifiers is intrinsically hard. Indeed, adding quantification to a theory
typically leads to undecidability or to a much higher complexity class.
However, quantifiers are extremely important in modeling real-world problems.
In recent years there has been exciting progress in the research on
quantifier reasoning.  A number of novel solving paradigms can be found in
various domains. Prime examples are quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) and
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).  While quantifiers have similar semantics
across different logics, the exchange between the different fields is limited.
It is the objective of this session to bring together researchers tackling
quantifiers from various angles.  We believe that promoting such discussion
enables mutual enrichment of the individual areas.

##### Topics (including, but not limited to)

*   satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)
*   quantifier elimination
*   quantified Boolean formula (QBF)
*   first/higher order logic (FOL/HOL)
*   quantified interpolants

### Journal Special Issue

*   A  _journal special issue_ consisting of _full papers_ will be organized immediately after the meeting.
*   After the meeting, the submission guideline for a journal special issue will be communicated to you by the session organizers.

## 19. Formal and Informal Mathematical Corpora

### Organizers

*   [Yihe Dong](mailto:yihed@wolfram.com) (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL, USA)
*   [Robert Y. Lewis](mailto:rob.y.lewis@gmail.com) (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, NL)

### Aim and Scope

This session aims to connect a constellation of topics related to processing
corpora of mathematical texts. NLP on informal mathematical documents
presents many interesting challenges, and can be aided by the presence of 
corresponding formal documents (interpreted broadly). Creating and maintaining
these corpora presents even more challenges. We hope to bring together
researchers thinking about the retrieval, curation, and interpretation   
of formal and informal mathematical texts, as well as the underlying languages
used in these projects and the connections between them. There are many exciting projects 
underway in all of these areas, and a combined session will spur fruitful
discussions and help to align the work of different groups.

#### Topics (including, but not limited to)

* The creation and curation of mathematical corpora (e.g. Hales'
  Formal Abstracts project)
* The parsing and interpreting of natural language mathematics into more
  formal domains (e.g. symbolic or AI techniques for mining and searching the arXiv)
* Target languages for these interpretations and the connections between them
  (e.g. computer algebra systems and proof assistants)
