## 3. Symbolic Summation and Integration

### Organizers

*   [Christoph Koutschan](mailto:christoph.koutschan@ricam.oeaw.ac.at) (Austrian Academy of Sciences)

### Aim and Scope

The symbolic evaluation of (definite and indefinite) sums and integrals
is an important topic in symbolic computation, and it is widely
appreciated by users of computer algebra systems. From highschool
students, who solve their homework integrals with freely available and
easy-to-use tools such as WolframAlpha, to physicists, who employ highly
specialized algorithms and software packages for simplifying complicated
multi-sums, they all take advantage of the power of computer algebra
software. This session is dedicated to the presentation and discussion
of new trends in the areas of symbolic summation and symbolic
integration, with a special emphasis on newly developed software for
evaluating / simplifying sums and integrals, either in an explicit /
implicit form or numerically.
