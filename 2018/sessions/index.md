# International Congress on Mathematical Software - ICMS 2018
## Notre Dame, 24-27 July 2018

The congress is organized in sessions, addressing different aspects of mathematical
software. There will be also demos, tutorials and posters. If you would like to give a
talk, you need to submit first a short abstract and then later an extended abstract to one
of the organizers of the corresponding session. Proceedings of ICMS'18 will be published in the Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series.  See the [guidelines](http://icms-conference.org/2018/call-for-submissions/) for the details.  


### Publications

*   A _short abstract_ will appear on the permanent conference web page (see below) as soon as accepted. 

*   An _extended abstract_ will appear on the permanent conference web page (see below) as soon as accepted. 
    It will also appear on the LNCS proceedings that will be distributed during the meeting.

*   Some sessions will organize a _journal special issue_  consisting of _full papers_ after the meeting.
