### Aim and Scope

In addition to traditional software for numerics and symbolics (in
algebra, analysis, combinatorics, etc.), more and more software for
automated reasoning based on sophisticated general and special
reasoning techniques with nice user interfaces enriches the
possibilities of working mathematicians, computer scientists and
engineers. 

#### Topics 

* new versions of automated reasoning software
* user interfaces for automated reasoning software
* new implementations of general and special reasoning techniques
* interaction of automated reasoning software with numerical and algebraic software
* applications of automated reasoning in mathematics, computer science, natural sciences, engineering, education,
* the use of automated reasoning in the build-up of formal mathematical knowledge bases
* and related subjects.
