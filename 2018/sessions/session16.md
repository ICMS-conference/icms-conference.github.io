### Aim and Scope


Exact and certified numeric computations produce rigorous and reliable results which are vital in algebraic geometry, geometric computing, cryptography, program verification, and many other areas of science and engineering. This session aims at bringing researchers from Mathematics and Computer Science together with software developers and engineers to present advances and on-going work on the development of software for symbolic and certified numeric computations with nonlinear, algebraic, differential, geometric, and hybrid systems. 

### Topics 

+ Design and implementation of efficient software systems for exact and certified numeric computations
+ Software for exact and certified numeric computations with algebraic or differential or geometric systems (including parametric ones)
+ Methodologies, paradigms, and algorithms for exact and certified numeric computations based on symbolic manipulation and interval methods
+ Special-purpose software packages, toolkits, interfaces, and knowledge bases using exact and certified numeric computations and for safety-critical applications
+ Case and experimental studies, software comparison, combination, and integration, and complexity analysis for exact, certified, and symbolic-numeric hybrid computations
